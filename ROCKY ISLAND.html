Rocky Island is a new tourist destination in Dooars. Situated on the banks of the River Murti it is about 2 km from Samsing and is a popular camping site. The view of river and surrounding forests are excellent from Rocky Island but tourist amenities are basic. Accommodation is arranged in small Tents for overnight visitors. The campsite provides an excellent opportunity to explore the interior parts of Neora Valley National sanctuary. This place is best suited for adventurous activities like trekking, rock climbing & rappelling. This is the must visit place for adventure loving travellers. A small enjoyable trek to nearby spots like Sherpagaon, Bhalukope, Jhandidara and Mo-chuki is an added attraction of this place. The road to Rocky Island is full of pebbles and it ends at the bridge over the Murti.
The river is quite narrow here and flows playfully amongst the boulders. You can spend some time there dipping our feet in the cold water of the river. You can stay at the Rocky Island Nature Resort which is located on the banks of Murti River. You will be provided tents for overnight stay to enjoy the beautiful and mysterious atmosphere of the region. If you wish to see the lifestyle of the local people, then Faribasti homestay will be the best option for you. Experience their hospitality and also their love for nature.
