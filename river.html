Jayanti is a small forest village within Buxa Tiger Reserve in Alipurduar district of West Bengal, India. It is located along the Jayanti River, forming a natural border with the Bhutan hills. It is popular with hikers for its beautiful views of the surrounding landscape and wild fountains.

A picturesque place within the Buxa Tiger Reserve along the meandering Jayanti River is an ideal place to relax and rejuvenate in the midst of nature. This somewhat off-beat destination is fast becoming popular as an eco-tourism hot spot. Often referred to as the ''Queen of Dooars'', this picturesque place provides a perfect setting for a memorable tour. With no mobile network you will definitely enjoy the peace of true holiday and be able to spend some time discovering and rediscovering yourself. Time spent with your loved ones at this remotest corner of earth will definitely be an experience of a life time.

Located along the Jayanti River, which forms a natural border with the Bhutan hills, this beautiful place offers all the peace and tranquility that is so missing in a busy city life. A tour of Jayanti, away from the humdrum of city life is an ideal leisure holiday destination where time seems to have slowed down its fast pace. Music of the swift flowing Jayanti River, chirping of unknown birds, sweet fragrance of nature and refreshingly cool breeze at Jayanti will make you feel completely rejuvenated. Though the river remains dry for most of the year but its white beds with pebbles all around imparts an unmatched beauty to the place.

Way to Jayanti through the densely forested Buxa Tiger Reserve is a fascinating experience and another huge attraction of Jayanti tour. Meeting a herd of Elephant or Spotted Deer or plenty of Peacocks are most common sights on the way to Jayanti.
